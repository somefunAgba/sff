## Also called: Five-perent Uniformly Damped Binomial Filters (UDBMF5)

In this paper, the five-percent maximum overshoot design of uniformly damped binomial filters (transfer functions) is introduced. To extend the maximum overshoot response of the second-order Butterworth to higher orders, the binomial theorem is extended to the uniformly damped binomial theorem.
